The best place to start when brainstorming activities that your loved one might enjoy is taking inventory of their past and current interests and hobbies. Examples might include gardening, crafting, playing or watching sports, cooking, reading about historical events, fishing, photography, or listening to or playing certain types of music. Once you’ve made a list of potential ideas, it’s time to get creative.   Hobbies often fall by the wayside when a senior experiences increasing physical and/or mental challenges.

Keeping things simple and straightforward is often the best course of action when coming up with activities for people with Alzheimer's. Going to a local park to feed the birds and fish is an easy task that may be very fun for a person with Alzheimer's. You can also take turns reading a favorite book aloud. This can be an easy way to encourage a senior to exercise their mind while giving them the pleasure of reading a beloved book. Listen to music.   Research has shown that listening to music can help a person with Alzheimer's remember events, people, and places from their past. Additionally, music can be a way to get a senior moving through dance or song. Music can be themed to match your needs; sing along activities, upbeat motivating tunes, or relaxing sounds may all play a part in your day. Cook and clean.\n",

Some people are still able to do things, like read, do puzzles, watch TV, tend to plants, etc., but some are not. I found that unless there is a person leading, directing and involving the patient, they may not have the insight or motivation to engage in an activity. There are activity boards that you can purchase that sit in the person’s lap or on a table and have various tasks on them, like buttons, zippers, and Velcro, and include things that have different textures and even make sounds.

The best place to start when brainstorming activities that your loved one might enjoy is taking inventory of their past and current interests and hobbies. Examples might include gardening, crafting, playing or watching sports, cooking, reading about historical events, fishing, photography, or listening to or playing certain types of music. Once you’ve made a list of potential ideas, it’s time to get creative.   Hobbies often fall by the wayside when a senior experiences increasing physical and/or mental challenges. Beth Kallmyer, former Director of Family and Information Services for the Alzheimer’s Association, recommends adjusting these pastimes to fit their abilities. Providing additional assistance and supervision is often necessary with dementia patients, but as their condition progresses, adapting the activities themselves is also required.',\n",

Keeping things simple and straightforward is often the best course of action when coming up with activities for people with Alzheimer's. Going to a local park to feed the birds and fish is an easy task that may be very fun for a person with Alzheimer's. You can also take turns reading a favorite book aloud. This can be an easy way to encourage a senior to exercise their mind while giving them the pleasure of reading a beloved book. Listen to music.   Research has shown that listening to music can help a person with Alzheimer's remember events, people, and places from their past. Additionally, music can be a way to get a senior moving through dance or song. Music can be themed to match your needs; sing along activities, upbeat motivating tunes, or relaxing sounds may all play a part in your day. Cook and clean.\",\n",

Some people are still able to do things, like read, do puzzles, watch TV, tend to plants, etc., but some are not. I found that unless there is a person leading, directing and involving the patient, they may not have the insight or motivation to engage in an activity. There are activity boards that you can purchase that sit in the person’s lap or on a table and have various tasks on them, like buttons, zippers, and Velcro, and include things that have different textures and even make sounds. They are designed specifically for people with dementia and are aimed at keeping a person's hands busy and providing mental stimulation.” –Sunnygirl1\",\n",

Memory care communities provide 24-hour care and supervision. Many communities also offer a secure environment with activities that aim to keep your loved one physically and mentally engaged. Hospice and palliative care The primary goal of hospice and palliative care is to provide a higher quality of life for the patient. Many of the infections that can lead to the death of a person living with dementia are treatable. However, when reviewing treatments for a person with dementia, it’s important to consider their quality of life. In the late stage of dementia, the side effects of many drug therapies can outweigh the benefits, as individuals can be frail and infections often return. Managing pain and other symptoms helps a patient remain comfortable. Hospice teams can also provide helpful suggestions to family and friends on how they can continue to connect with their loved one during the late stages of dementia. Hospice and palliative care also benefit families by offering caregiving assistance and emotional support.',\n",

You can best meet these challenges by using creativity, flexibility, patience, and compassion. It also helps to not take things personally and maintain your sense of humor. To start, consider these ground rules: We cannot change the person. The person you are caring for has a brain disorder that shapes who he has become. When you try to control or change his behavior, you’ll most likely be unsuccessful or be met with resistance. It’s important to: Try to accommodate the behavior, not control the behavior. For example, if the person insists on sleeping on the floor, place a mattress on the floor to make him more comfortable. Remember that we can change our behavior or the physical environment. Changing our own behavior will often result in a change in our loved one’s behavior.',\n",
